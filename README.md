#JeremyRPG

My first attempt at making a JRPG (but now the J stands for Jeremy). You have one objective: fight the monster in front you and win (the monster may look like it's from DOOM, that's because it is...).

You do have some tools in your arsenal though. You can:
* Go in bare-fisted and punch your way to victory
* Use powerful magic to level the playing field
* Make use of a (limited) suply of health potions and ethers
  to help you stay standing
* Block your enemy attacks if you think they're going to hit hard.

But beware, whatever you can do, your enemy is also capable of (that includes having items)...




But I believe in you, so make me proud.




##How the game came to be:

The game is essentially multiple methods and event listeners working together to simiulate a game looping until a victory condition. 

The player has dedicated functions for each action, allowing them to choose how'd they like to approach each turn, as well as having further optionss when using magic or items. 

The enemy also has dedicated functions for fighting, magic and items (guard can be implemented in the future).

The game is built on the foundation framework and style (only slightly) with SASS (more info on tools below)


##Tools used:
Foundation by ZURB, HTML, SASS, Javascript, GarageBand and Heroku
